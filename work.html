        <li><h4>Farm Schooling</h4>
        <h5>Farm Schooling and Home Schooling my daughter from 2013 (India)</h5>
        <p>Self learning in the appropriate environment is an 
        opportunity to be given for every child. I am happy that 
        I was able to provide that opportunity for my daughter. 
        She has moulded to a compasionate, responsible, 
        conscious and ethical person at the age of 11. Though
        this I have gained patience, perseverence, confidence,
        adaptability, growth mindset, teamwork, coordination,
        aquiring knowledge, boundless learning, build strong community,
        upskilling with ease, becoming artistic, creative, loving, caring,
        orphaning, and many many.

            <li> <h4> MudRock Constructions</h4>
            <h5>Designer, Project Manager from 2016, Coimbatore (India) </h5>
            <P> With long time passion and interest, I built my own farm house
                with sustainable materials like stone, wood and cob. I also 
                incorporated modern materials like cement, lime and glass. 
                Seeing the project, I was asked to design few buildings around
                and I learnt a lot working with architects, engineers and tradesmen. 
                I had the opportunity to learn indegeneous building techniques, and had several 
                environmentalists, to talk about suastainability engineering.
