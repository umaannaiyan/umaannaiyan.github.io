        <p> I am also a eco-concious person. 
            I have built a sustainable house with stones and 
            natural materials. I like to keep my life balanced
            with a creative career, have a weekend full of nature talk with family around
            and cook nice meals to enjoy the nature's nourishment.</p>

        <li>
        <h4>ClickandHop</h4>
        <h5>Co-Founder and Developer, Since 2019 (Australia) </h5>
     <p>Click&Hop is a social enterprise 
         thriving to form a
         digitally-powered community and also
        provides information and opportunities 
        for students 
        wanting to learn/study
        anywhere in the world.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Farm Schooling</h4>
    <h5>Farm Schooling and Home Schooling my daughter from 2013 (India)</h5>
    <p>Self learning in the appropriate environment is an 
    opportunity to be given for every child. I am happy that 
    I was able to provide that opportunity for my daughter. 
    She has moulded to a compasionate, responsible, 
    conscious and ethical person at the age of 11. Though
    this I have gained patience, perseverence, confidence,
    adaptability, growth mindset, teamwork, coordination,
    aquiring knowledge, boundless learning, build strong community,
    upskilling with ease, becoming artistic, creative, loving, caring,
    orphaning, and many many.

        <li> <h4> MudRock Constructions</h4>
        <h5>Designer, Project Manager from 2016, Coimbatore (India) </h5>
        <P> With long time passion and interest, I built my own farm house
            with sustainable materials like stone, wood and cob. I also 
            incorporated modern materials like cement, lime and glass. 
            Seeing the project, I was asked to design few buildings around
            and I learnt a lot working with architects, engineers and tradesmen. 
            I had the opportunity to learn indegeneous building techniques, and had several 
            environmentalists, to talk about suastainability engineering. 

        </P>
